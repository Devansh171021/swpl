This PR normalizes Google Drive and Dropbox image links retrieved from the Google Sheet to direct image URLs (e.g. converts Drive preview links to drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=...). It also adds an image onError fallback to show a placeholder instead of hiding the image, and adds crossOrigin/referrerPolicy attributes. Branch fix/normalize-image-urls contains the change to src/pages/Index.tsx.
