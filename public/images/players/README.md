# Player Images

Place player images in this folder.

## Naming Convention
Name your images using the player's name from your Google Sheet (exact match or sanitized version).

Examples:
- `Virat Kohli.jpg` or `virat-kohli.jpg`
- `MS Dhoni.png` or `ms-dhoni.png`
- `Jasprit Bumrah.jpg` or `jasprit-bumrah.jpg`

## Supported Formats
- `.jpg` or `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## How It Works
The app will automatically look for images matching the player's name. If found, it will use the local image. Otherwise, it will fall back to the URL from your Google Sheet.

## Tips
- Keep file names consistent with player names in your sheet
- Use lowercase with hyphens for better compatibility: `player-name.jpg`
- Recommended size: 400x600px or similar 3:4 aspect ratio
